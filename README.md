Technology stack requirements- 

Protégé Ontology Editor,
Python,
RDFLIB library (can be installed using "pip install rdflib"),

To generate RDF file - Please run the "csv_rdf.py" python file, where the csv input files are "reduced_dataset1.csv " and "reduced_dataset2.csv"

After sucessfully executing the python code- The (.rdf) files are generated, in this case they are  "dataset1.rdf" and "dataset2.rdf" files.
